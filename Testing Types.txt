Testing Types:
    * verification
    * Validation

verification:

    * verification is an observation /checking or cross checking is also called as quality assurance/static testing.

    * Static Testing is done the testing the application without execution.

    * Process as well as product oriented.

    * Each phases of SDLC 

    *Working progress activity.

    * Slogan of verification
        are we building the right product.

Types of verification:
    * Informal(walkthrough)
    * Formal(Inspection)

Informal:
    => No rules No regulation.
    => open ended session.
    => It is contacted by author

    => Agenda and MOM

Validation:

    => quality control/quality centre
    => Dynamic Testing during testing we can change the input.
    => Testing the application with execution.
    => Product oriented.
    => Slogan of Validation
        are you building the right product.
    =>Consistency,correctly,completeness

Types of Validation:
 
Unit Testing:

    * Unit Testing is a smallest part of the large application
    * Unit Testing focus area on code
    * unit testing done by dev team as per the company guideline.
    * control flow,Data Flow, memory leak problem
    * Main aim is to optimize the code.
    * pod testing and component testing is also known as unit testing.
    * software used for unit testing is JUnit(Java Unit).

Integration Testing:

    * Clubbing or merging the multiple module together.
    * A main aim of Integrated Testing after Clubbing or merging that application should be work as client expectation.
    * Incremental Approach:
        => In Incremental Approach if two module are ready we will start the testing the communication between them.
    * Non-Incremental Approach:
        => In Non-Incremental we will wait for all module are ready after that only we will Approach to test the application.


System Testing:

    Has Three types:
        * usability Testing
        * Functional Testing.
        * Non-Functional Testing

usability Testing: 
    => Easy to use
    => usability testing also know as accessability testing.
    => In this testing we will check the look and feel color combination and also shape size and hight and width.
