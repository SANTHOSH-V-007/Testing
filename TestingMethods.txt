Testing Method:
    Two types:
        * Black Box Testing
        * White Box Testing.


Black Box Testing:

    => Box is software.
    => In Black box testing we will pass input and check output.
    => In Black box testing we will no check coding or internal mechanism.
    => Black box testing also called input output testing.
    => Black box testing comes under system testing.
    => Also called as close box testing.

Black box test design techniques:
    * ECP(Equivalence class partitioning)
    * BVA(Boundary value analysis)
    * DT(Decision Table)
    * STT(State Transition Testing)
    * Use case based testing


ECP(Equivalence class partitioning):means combination of valid and invalid

    Step 1: Identity class
    Step 2: Divide the class into partition
    Step 3: Take any one value from each class
    Step 4: Test or implement the selected.

1. what is valid esp value? any value between given range
    => Valid ecp Value that comes in same Equivalence class or in range
    eg: Range(5-17) ans: 11 

2. Invalid ecp value: is not the range,select the value that not in the given range.
    => Invalid ecp value that comes in less that given limit and greater than given limit.
    eg: Range(5-17) ans: 4,18

3. same Equivalence class 
    => It contain only before range and after range and inside range 
        eg: 5-12 ans:(1,2,3),(6,7,8),(13,14,15)

4. ECP(Equivalence class partitioning):means combination of valid and invalid 
    eg. Range(5-17) ans: 3, 11, 20


page contain text box which accept alpha numeric value Identity valid Equivalence value
    1. BOOK
    2. book
    3. Boo01k(correct answer)
    4. BooK

In a examination students want to get 25 marks or max 40 marks identity valid Equivalence value if clear exam
    1.22 23 26
    2.29 30 38(correct answer)
    3.21 29 40
    4. 0 15 22

One of the field of the farm contain text box which accept range between 18 to 25 identity invalid Equivalence value.

    1. 19 
    2. 21 
    3. 24 
    4. 17(correct answer)

Switch is switch off once temperature is off when 18 below and turn on when temperature is 21 .
identity Equivalence value which belong to the same class

    1. 12 16 22
    2. 24 27 17
    3. 23 25 25( correct answer)
    4. 14 15 19

Program contain numeric field as follow value less than 10 are rejected value between 10 and 21 accept and value greater than or equal to 22 is reject
which is follow all Equivalence partition.

 1. 10 11 21
 2. 3 10 22(correct answer)
 3. 10 21 22
 4. 3 20 21


 BVA(Boundary value analysis):

    => Boundary value analysis used to test lower Boundary and upper Boundary

* Valid Boundary: 4-8 range  ans is 4 and 8 is valid Boundary

* Invalid Boundary: 4-8 range ans: 4-1=3 and 8+1=9 so 3,9 is answer

* MostBoundary Value: combination of valid and invalid 
    ex: 4-8 range ans is 3,4,8,9 


Find out valid ecp value and valid Boundary
a).4,8
b). 4,7,10
c). 5,7,8
d). 4,6,8 (correct answer)

Range(5-17)

ecp - 3, 11, 20
MostBoundary value - 5,4,17,18
invalid ecp value - 4, 19
valid Boundary - 5, 17
same Equivalence class - (1,2,3)(6,7,8),(18,19,20)
valid ecp value - 11
invalid Boundary - 4, 18
valid ecp and valid Boundary - 5, 10, 17


    DT(Decision Table):

    Decision Table means taking the Decision for writing input.


    STT(State Transition Testing):

    => In state Transition testing we will check the application flow from one step to another.

given the state diagram which path will take a minimum series of valid transaction to cover every state.

s5 s1 s2 s4 s1 s3 es (correct path or shortest path)
s5 s1 s2 s4 s1 s3 s4 s1 s3 es
s5 s1 s2 s3 s4 s3 s4 es
s5 s1 s4 s2 s1 s3 es

    Use case based testing:

    => Use case diagram created by higher authority which decide which feature available for which user.
    



White Box Testing.

    => White Box Testing is opposite to black box testing
    => white Box is also called ad glass box testing
    => open box is called as white box Testing
    => In white box testing we will pass input and check how input are process and output are generated.
    => It will deals with internal mechanism.
    => white box testing comes in unit level.

White Box techniques:

    => Statement Coverage
    => Decision Coverage
    => conditional Coverage

Statement Coverage:

    Step 1:  understand logic of the code 
    Step 2:  Draw flow based upon program flow
    Step 3:  compare flow chart with code

    Statement Coverage increase when else path is there.

In Statement Coverage we will execute all the Statement but in minimum attempt

    Read a, read b, c = a-2*b , if c<0 print c Negative


Decision Coverage:

    => Decision Coverage focus on diamond
    => minimum Decision condition is true.

Eg: read newspaper switch on tv if interested program watch that program else continue reading if we have buzzle we will doing the buzzle
