Software Development Life cycle:

    SDLC is a combination of Steps for developing or creating a Application.

    7 Steps of SDLC:

        * Requirement gathering
        * Analysis
        * Design
        * Development
        * Testing
        * Deployment
        * Maintenance
        

1. Requirement gathering: 
    What is the need of the customer is know to Requirement and collecting the data from the customer is 
    know as gathering.

    SRS -Software Requirement Specification
    CRS- Customer Requirement Specification
    URS- User Requirement Specification


2. Analysis:

In this phases a BA team will schedule a internal meeting to discuss of business requirement.
        * MOM-Minutes of meeting
        * Agenda
    FS-Friability study meeting 

    * Time
    * Budget
    * Environment
    * Resource
    * Tech
    * Risk 

3. Design:
    In this phases the designer design the application based upton the requirements.

    Designing Two Types:
            * HLD - High level Design(Ex: Data flow diagram) - Overall Design of the application are created
            * LLD - Low Level Design(Ex: Entity Relationship Diagram) - Detailed Design of the application


4. Development:
        In this phase the developer refer the Design Document and start creating coding based upto the 
        requirement.


5. Testing:
    Testing is a process of finding defect.
    Two Types:
    * Expected result - user expect from the application.
    * Actual Result - when we used that app or test the app the test given by the application is known as actual result.

    * In this Phases we need to checking or observing the code.

    * +ve testing means passing valid input and check input is accepted or not.
    * -ve testing we will pass invalid input and check it will rejected or not.

Testing Types:
    * verification
    * Validation

Testing level:
    * Unit Testing.
    * Integration Testing.
    * System Testing.
    * User Acceptance Testing.

Testing Method:
    * Black-Box Testing.
    * White-Box Testing.



6. Deployment or implementation:

Three Environment are:
    * Dev - Developer Environment
    * Test - Tester Environment
    * Production - Client Environment

In this phase Tested application will release to the Client Side.


7.Maintenance

    In this phase organization take feedback from the client.
        This phase gives two parts:
            * Corrective 
            * Adaptive
        
        * In the corrective phase organization resolve the problem when the client report without taking extra money.
        * In the adaptive phase if client want any modification or new features in existing features
            to work on the new modification or feature organization required time and cost
