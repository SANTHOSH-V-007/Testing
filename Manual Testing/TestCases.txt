Test Cases:

    => Cases is nothing but condition
    => We will always write testcases based on requirement
    => Test cases can be positive as well as Negative
    => In ISTQB terminology how is to be tested is called as Test Cases


Test scenario:
    => scenario is nothing but high level description
    => In ISTQB terminology what is to be tested

Steps for Test Case scenario:

Test Case id:
    => Test Case id is unique number it will assign to the each and every test cases

Test Case Name:
    => Test Case Name nothing but a module name

Tester Name:
    => It is a name of the tester

Objective:
    => Purpose for write test cases or goal behind the test cases.

Pre-Condition:
    => It is a initial condition that is required.

Steps to follow:
    =>  Steps that required for testing.

Test Data:
    => Test Data is nothing but input to test the application.

Expected Result:
    => User expectation from the application is nothing but the Expected Result. We will always use 
        Requirement document to understand the Expected Result.

Actual Result:
    => Actual Result is result given by the application

Status:
    => Expected is match with actual result it will give complete status or else give not completed.
     => Pass ,Fail and Block
