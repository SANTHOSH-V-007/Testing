How to handle elements in selenium:

    Locating strategy in selenium:
        => By.xpath
        Xpath is combination of id and name.With the help of xpath we will get detailed information of
        web element.
        Two Types xpath:
            * absolute
            * relative
        Absolute start with /.will take a element from root node.
        Relative start with //.will take a element from current node.It is faster to locate element.


        => By.id 
        => By.name
        => By.LinkTest - pass the exact link 
        => By.Partial LinkTest
        => By.classname
        => By.cssselector
