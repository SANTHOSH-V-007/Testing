    * TestNG support to use for generating report.
    * It is used of parameterization.(executing a application with different input)
    * TestNG used for executing multiple test cases by using single click.
    * we will not run a single class we use a multiple class in TestSuit.


create a first test script in TestNG.
    Step by step process of creating TestNG:
    *   Create project
    *   Create Package
    *   Add selenium Jar
    *   Add TestNG Library.
    *   Create TestNG class


    => Default name of TestNG class is NewTest.

    => TestNG doesn't contain main method but it contain only annotation.
    => Annotation is a function or method which decide to execution.
    =>  @Test is a default annotation in TestNG
    => Default test case name is test.

Annotation Sequence: is used to flow of execution

    => Combination of multiple suit became class.
    => combination of multiple test case became method.
    => beforeSuite
    => beforeTest
    => beforeClass
    => beforeMethod
    => TestCase
    => afterMethod
    => afterClass
    => afterTest
    => afterSuite
    => No annotation is compulsory.
    => Before method and after method annotation we depends on the test case.it will run two times.

Types of TestCases:
    => Priority Testing.
    => Skip the test case. 
        * [@Test(enabled = false)] is not consider execution
        * [@Test(enabled = pass)] is  consider execution
    => Run a multiple class in TestNG
        * To run multiple class you need to create xml File.
