SDLC MODELS:

    * WaterFall Models.
    * Spiral Models.
    * Agile Models.

WaterFall Model:
    * It is a classical model developing application.
    * It is used for linear and sequential Model.
    * Used when requirement are fixed.
    * used for small project.
    * High amount of risk and Uncertainty.
    * In this phase we don't go the another phase 

Spiral Models:(when client don't know the final outcome of the application so we use Spiral model)
    * use when requirement are change.
    * Incremental(adding new features in the existing module) and 
        iterative(reparative model) for the application.
    * prototype model also a sample application for client.
    * Spiral Models used for ongoing Project.
    * Spiral Models is costly and time consuming.

Agile Models:
    * Meaning of agile is move quickly or fast.
    * Agile use when the requirement are changes.
    * In agile entire project information will present in the requirement list.
    * we will divide requirement list into Multiple parts.
    * In agile short term planning are preferred.
    * In agile better team work and better communication will have.
    * In agile we can work on the client requirement at any point.

Framework in agile:
    => Agile is concept or theory we will use Framework or process that process is called scrum.
    => Agile is also a Incremental and iterative model.

    * Product Backlog or user story nothing but all the modules or feature available in the application.

    * Release requirement contains those requirement in which developed application are Release to the client.


Meeting in scrum or agile:
    => Sprint (time duration do all the process and release the application to client side within the time duration)
        * In Sprint meeting  point manager decide with client which features we need to release to the client.
        * For releasing that features has much time and effort are required comes under Sprint.
    => Planning 
    => Meeting


* Story is a module name or feature name which we release to the client side.
* Task is a individual work item.
* Epic is a combination of multiple task.

Types of Meeting:

    1. Daily meeting or standup meeting or scrum meeting:
        * Main goal is to check the progress of the task daily.

    2.Sprint retro/petro meeting:
        * In this meeting we need to give demo to the client.And also client gives some feedback.
         And also client provided modification if required.

    3. Sprint grooming meeting:
        * In Sprint grooming meeting scrum master taking feedback each and every team member.
            It will contacted only after two spring.

    4. Sprint closure meeting:
        * In this meeting a scrum master check all the assign atom should mark as close.After that only 
            they start another spring.
