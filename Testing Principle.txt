Testing Principles:

    *=> Testing is Context(domain) Dependent:
          * we can apply testing for different project.

    *=> Exhaustive testing is impossible
        * We can not test filled with each and every input.

    => Early Testing
        * we should start testing from the first phase to reduce time, effort, cost.

    *=>Pesticide paradox(change):
        * use some technique or input to find some defect.
        * In Pesticide paradox we always change or update our input to find out problems.

    =>Testing show presence of defect:
        * with the help of testing we can check the defect is available on application or not.

    =>Defect Clustering:
        * Defect means different between Expected or actual.
        * Clustering means grouping
        * In this Principle we need to focus on starting module of application and critical module of application.

    *=> Absence of error for missing requirement:
        *In this principle any module is miss then the application rejected by the client.
        *To avoid this problem maintain a good Relationship and proper communication with entire team.
